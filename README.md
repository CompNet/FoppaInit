## Description
These scripts are meant to create the Foppa database from raw TED files. Foppa contains the award notices of public contracts related to French clients from 2010 to 2020 in the Tenders Electronic Daily. Foppa proposes an enrichment of these data, thanks to the siretization of agents as well as the cleaning and extraction of award criteria.
